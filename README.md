# Web Visualization Dashboard 
Creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations. <br>

Individual pages for each plot that provides a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.<br>

The website has on top of every page a navigation menu that:<br>
* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.<br>
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.<br>
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.<br>
* Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots ["Navigation Menu" section](#navigation-menu) (notice the background color change).<br>
